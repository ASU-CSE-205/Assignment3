1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

-- Every decision a software engineer makes, from releasing software to working on
projects, has to consider the welfare of the public. Nothing that puts people in harms way 
should be produced. This includes taking the blame and responsibility for software that is 
produced, revealing any possible issues with the software, and including accessibility for
everyone within the software. An example of this is not releasing a social media platform
that affects the mental health of users. 

2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best 
interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

-- Software engineers are expected to make decisions that are asked for and benefit the client
and employer. This means that one shouldn't abuse their power and accessibility to exploit 
the information or property that they have access to. Side projects or other jobs should not 
be taken unless it is absolutely guaranteed that it would not be detrimental to the work of the
job. Any choice that has to be made by a software engineer should be to help the client and employer,
unequivocally. An example of this is to maintain the privacy of an employer and not selling trade secrets to
competitors. 

3. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional 
judgment.

-- The integrity and independence of a software engineer must be unwavering. Bribes and
conflicts of interest should be avoided at all costs. Evaluations of sotware should be strictly
objective and not take character of an individual or opinions into consideration. An example of this is
to turn down a bribe from a competitor to tank the release of software.

4. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical 
approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

-- Management in software engineering have a large amount of power and influence over the software
engineers in their team. This is not something that should be taken lightly. The engineers in a team
are responsible for looking over the engineers and ensuring that their work is meeting the standards
that are set forth. Hearing out engineers and giving out assignments that are fair and meeting an
engineer's abilities is expected as well. An example of this is giving an employee guidance when they
have concerns on how they should go about implementing a solution without affecting the integrity of the 
software.

5. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

-- Engineers work in teams and should be held responsible for ensuring that their colleagues
maintain integrity and follow the Software Engineering Code to the best of their abilites. 
Assisting colleagues in their work and making sure that the best and safest product is shipped
to clients is part of the job description. Using colleagues for assistance, especially in an area
that is their expertise, is highly recommended. An example of this is giving credit where credit is due,
especially if it is the work of a colleague.
